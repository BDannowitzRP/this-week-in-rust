# Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [coercible_errors](https://crates.io/crates/coercible_errors), a library that allows generic trait implementations to omit the size cost of `Result::Err` if errors never happen.

Thanks to [Zac Burns](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/763) for the suggestion!

[Submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

# Quote of the Week

> Vecs in Rust in general, are crazy fast; faster than I can replicate in C. Amazing.
